# Vblog - Video Blog App Vuejs

Vblog is a platform that allows users to share their videos and happy moments with the world. All users can view and interact with the shared videos.

This app is built using Vue3 as the framework, Tailwind as the styling framework, and Firebase as the database and user login/registration system. It was created as a test for my first company, and is live at [Live Demo](https://keen-noyce-2540a3.netlify.app/).


## Features

- User registration and login system powered by Firebase.
- Ability to post and view videos from other users.
- Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation.


## Dependencies

This app depends on the following packages:

- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) - a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - a platform for building mobile and web applications that provides a realtime database, authentication services, and hosting.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a utility-first CSS framework.
